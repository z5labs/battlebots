## Idea

This proof of concept demonstrates containerized bots battling each other in a 1v1 match within a 2-dimensional space. To evaluate the optimal architecture for the final BattleBots platform, both a client/server implementation and a peer-to-peer implementation will be completed and compared.

## Requirements

### Client/Server Architecture

Implement a client/server architecture to evaluate its suitability for the final BattleBots platform.

### Peer-to-Peer Architecture

Implement a peer-to-peer architecture to compare against the client/server approach.

### 1v1 Battle

Bots compete in a 1v1 battle within a 2-dimensional space.

### Containerized Bots

Each bot should be a container to ensure isolation and portability.

### Language-Agnostic Bot Implementation

The game logic should be independent of each bot so that any programming language can be used to implement a bot.

### Observability

Observability signals should be captured so the battle can be monitored in real-time.

### Battle Visualization

A battle visualization should be implemented to display the battle state and actions.

## Pending ADRs

### Game Mechanics ADRs (0005-0009)

The core game mechanics for 1v1 battles are defined across multiple ADRs:

- **[ADR-0005: BattleBot Universe Topological Properties](../adrs/0005-battlebot-universe-topological-properties.md)**: Mathematical and topological foundation defining the spatial structure (2D Euclidean space, Cartesian coordinates, rectangular boundaries)
- **[ADR-0006: Bot Characteristics System](../adrs/0006-bot-characteristics-system.md)**: Four-stat system (Health, Speed, Defense, Mass) defining bot capabilities
- **[ADR-0007: Equipment and Loadout System](../adrs/0007-equipment-loadout-system.md)**: Equipment-based customization enabling diverse bot builds
- **[ADR-0008: Bot Actions and Resource Management](../adrs/0008-bot-actions-resource-management.md)**: Dual-constraint action system with energy costs and cooldowns

See also [Game Mechanics Analysis](../analysis/game-mechanics/) for detailed technical specifications.

### ADR-NNNN: Client/Server Architecture

This ADR will document the design decisions for the client/server implementation, including the server's responsibilities for game state management, turn coordination, and validation of bot actions.

### ADR-NNNN: Peer-to-Peer Architecture

This ADR will document the design decisions for the peer-to-peer implementation, including consensus mechanisms for game state, conflict resolution, and how bots communicate directly with each other.

### ADR-NNNN: Game Runtime Architecture

This ADR will define the "game loop" and core game mechanics, including turn-based vs. real-time gameplay, tick rates, state updates, and the overall flow of battle execution.

### ADR-NNNN: Bot to Battle Server Interface

This ADR will define the communication protocol between bots and the battle server or between bots in P2P mode, evaluating options such as gRPC, HTTP, or custom TCP/UDP packets.

### ADR-NNNN: Observability Stack

This ADR will document the observability architecture, including metrics collection, logging, tracing, and how battle telemetry is captured and exposed for monitoring and analysis.

### ADR-NNNN: Battle Visualization

This ADR will document the design of the battle visualization system, including the rendering approach, real-time updates, and how observability data is translated into visual representations.
