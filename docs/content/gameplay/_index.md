Welcome to the Battle Bots gameplay documentation! This section provides comprehensive mechanics guides for different battle types available in Battle Bots.

Each battle type has its own self-contained documentation covering the specific rules, mechanics, and systems that apply to that mode. This organization allows each battle type to have unique mechanics while maintaining clear, focused documentation.

## Available Battle Types

### [1v1 Battles](1v1-battles/)

Two bots face off in a direct confrontation. Learn about the arena, bot characteristics, equipment systems, and available actions for 1v1 combat.

## What is Battle Bots?

Battle Bots is a PVP game platform where you implement autonomous bots that battle each other in real-time. Each bot is independent software that reacts to game state and performs actions in a battle space. Your bot's success depends on your programming skills and the algorithms you implement.

## Getting Started

To start building your bot:

1. Choose a battle type to learn about (start with [1v1 Battles](1v1-battles/))
2. Read the mechanics documentation for that battle type
3. Check out the bot SDK for your preferred programming language
4. Implement your bot's logic and decision-making
5. Test your bot in battles and iterate on your approach

Battle Bots is a programming challenge - the documentation explains the mechanics, but figuring out effective strategies is up to you!
