## Idea

This proof of concept demonstrates containerized bots battling each other in a 1v1 match within a 2-dimensional space. To evaluate the optimal architecture for the final BattleBots platform, both a client/server implementation and a peer-to-peer implementation will be completed and compared.

## Requirements

- Implement a client/server architecture
- Implement a peer-to-peer architecture
- Bots compete in a 1v1 battle
- Each bot should be a container
- The game logic should be independent of each bot so that any programming language can be used to implement a bot
- Observability signals should be captured so the battle can be monitored
- A battle visualization should be implemented

## Pending ADRs

- Client/Server architecture
- Peer-to-Peer architecture
- Game Runtime architecture (this will define the "game loop")
- Bot to Battle Server interface (e.g. gRPC, HTTP, custom TCP or UDP packets)
- Observability stack
- Battle visualization
