## Welcome!

Battle Bots is a game in which you, the human, implement an autonomous "bot" to do
battle with "bots" implemented by other humans.

## What is a Bot?

A bot is a independent piece of software which is programmed to battle other bots
by reacting to state updates (e.g. bot B moved to point A) and performing its own
actions (e.g. fire missile at point A).
