[{"body":"Idea This proof of concept demonstrates containerized bots battling each other in a 1v1 match within a 2-dimensional space.

Without a structured way to document these decisions, we risk losing the context and rationale behind important choices, making it difficult for current and future team members to understand why certain approaches were taken.\nHow should we document architectural decisions in a way that is accessible, maintainable, and provides sufficient context for future reference?\nDecision Drivers Need for clear documentation of architectural decisions and their rationale Easy accessibility and searchability of past decisions Low barrier to entry for creating and maintaining decision records Integration with existing documentation workflow Version control friendly format Industry-standard approach that team members may already be familiar with Considered Options MADR (Markdown Architectural Decision Records) ADR using custom format Wiki-based documentation No formal ADR process Decision Outcome Chosen option: “MADR (Markdown Architectural Decision Records)”, because it provides a well-established, standardized format that is lightweight, version-controlled, and integrates seamlessly with our existing documentation structure. MADR 4.0.0 offers a clear template that captures all necessary information while remaining flexible enough for different types of decisions.\nConsequences Good, because MADR is a widely adopted standard with clear documentation and examples Good, because markdown files are easy to create, edit, and review through pull requests Good, because ADRs will be version-controlled alongside code, maintaining historical context Good, because the format is flexible enough to accommodate strategic, user-journey, and API design decisions Good, because team members can easily search and reference past decisions Neutral, because requires discipline to maintain and update ADR status as decisions evolve Bad, because team members need to learn and follow the MADR format conventions Confirmation Compliance will be confirmed through:\nCode reviews ensuring new architectural decisions are documented as ADRs ADRs are stored in docs/content/r\u0026d/adrs/ following the naming convention NNNN-title-with-dashes.md Regular reviews during architecture discussions to reference and update existing ADRs Pros and Cons of the Options MADR (Markdown Architectural Decision Records) MADR 4.0.0 is a standardized format for documenting architectural decisions using markdown.\nGood, because it’s a well-established standard with extensive documentation Good, because markdown is simple, portable, and version-control friendly Good, because it provides a clear structure while remaining flexible Good, because it integrates with static site generators and documentation tools Good, because it’s lightweight and doesn’t require special tools Neutral, because it requires some initial learning of the format Neutral, because maintaining consistency requires discipline ADR using custom format Create our own custom format for architectural decision records.\nGood, because we can tailor it exactly to our needs Bad, because it requires defining and maintaining our own standard Bad, because new team members won’t be familiar with the format Bad, because we lose the benefits of community knowledge and tooling Bad, because it may evolve inconsistently over time Wiki-based documentation Use a wiki system (like Confluence, Notion, or GitHub Wiki) to document decisions.\nGood, because wikis provide easy editing and hyperlinking Good, because some team members may be familiar with wiki tools Neutral, because it may or may not integrate with version control Bad, because content may not be version-controlled alongside code Bad, because it creates a separate system to maintain Bad, because it’s harder to review changes through standard PR process Bad, because portability and long-term accessibility may be concerns No formal ADR process Continue without a structured approach to documenting architectural decisions.\nGood, because it requires no additional overhead Bad, because context and rationale for decisions are lost over time Bad, because new team members struggle to understand why decisions were made Bad, because it leads to repeated discussions of previously settled questions Bad, because it makes it difficult to track when decisions should be revisited More Information MADR 4.0.0 specification: https://adr.github.io/madr/ ADRs will be categorized as: strategic, user-journey, or api-design ADR status values: proposed | accepted | rejected | deprecated | superseded by ADR-XXXX All ADRs are stored in docs/content/r\u0026d/adrs/ directory ","categories":"","description":"Adopt Markdown Architectural Decision Records (MADR) as the standard format for documenting architectural decisions in the project.\n","excerpt":"Adopt Markdown Architectural Decision Records (MADR) as the standard …","ref":"/battlebots/pr-preview/pr-142/rd/adrs/0001-use-madr-for-architecture-decision-records/","tags":"","title":"[0001] Use MADR for Architecture Decision Records"},{"body":"User Journeys This section contains detailed user journey documentation that defines how users interact with the Battlebots platform.

Each ADR follows the MADR 4.0.0 format and includes:\nContext and problem statement Decision drivers and constraints Considered options with pros and cons Decision outcome and rationale Consequences (positive and negative) Confirmation methods ADR Categories ADRs are classified into three categories:\nStrategic - High-level architectural decisions affecting the entire system (frameworks, authentication strategies, cross-cutting patterns). Use for foundational technology choices. User Journey - Decisions solving specific user journey problems. More tactical than strategic, but still architectural. Use when evaluating approaches to implement user-facing features. API Design - API endpoint implementation decisions (pagination, filtering, bulk operations). Use for significant API design trade-offs that warrant documentation.
